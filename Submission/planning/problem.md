Create a program that helps customers decide what anime they should watch. Use the flow chart in planning to build the system.
The program needs to ask a question, and the user will answer the question. The program then needs to ask another question,
based on the users previous answer.  Though these questions the chat bot will tell the user what anime they should watch.
