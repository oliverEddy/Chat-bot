# Chatbot

## Problem statement
What anime should I watch?
Create a program that helps customers decide what anime they should watch. The Chatbot will give users suggestions 
on what anime they should watch. The user will receive a suggestion based on their inputs/replies to the bot's questions.
Have you watched anime before? Did you enjoy this show? Would you watch something that is R16?
Use the flow chart in planning to build the system. The program needs to ask a question, and the user will answer the question.
The program then needs to ask another question, based on the users previous answer.
