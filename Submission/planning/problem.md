# Chatbot

## Problem statement
 What should I do tonight? 
 Write a program that helps customers decide how they should spend their night. The Chatbot should give users a suggestion as to how they should spend their night. The user will receive a suggestion based on their inputs/replies to the bot's questions. Is tonight a weekend or weeknight? Do you enjoy staying home or going out? Are your friends doing anything tonight? My chatbot will help customers decide what they should do tonight, solving the issue of not knowing what to do!
